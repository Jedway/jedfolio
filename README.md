# Jedfolio

My portfolio site written with the Svelte framework.

To reflect my code environment that I use in my editors and terminal emulators, I've themed the site according to
the GruvboxDarkHard theme and used Geist Mono for the font. 

Should be mobile responsive; automatically switching to a pill-shaped nav menu bar at the bottom once the viewport is detected
to be within "mobile dimensions"
